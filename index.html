<p> Eurt si em tuoba yas yeht gnihtyrevE <br>
    Euphoria <br>
    Them superpowers getting neutralized, I can only watch in silence <br>
    The famous actor we once knew is lookin' paranoid and now spiralin' <br>
    The one you said you loved is changing, you feel like you're just a victim <br> 
    You're movin' just like a degenerate, every antic is feelin' distasteful <br>
    You're losin' yourself, you're movin' in stealth <br>
    I calculate you're not as calculated, I can even predict your angle <br>
    Fabricating stories on the family front 'cause you heard Mr. Morale <br>
    A pathetic master manipulator, I can smell the tales on you now <br>
    You're not a rap artist, you a scam artist with the hopes of being accepted <br>
    Tommy Hilfiger stood out, but FUBU never had been your collection <br>
    I make music that electrify 'em, you make music that pacify 'em <br>
    I can double down on that line, but spare you this time, that's random acts of kindness <br>
    Know you a master manipulator and habitual liar too <br>
    But don't tell no lie about me and I won't tell truths 'bout you <br>
    Shoo, shoo, shoo <br>
    Shoo, shoo, shoo <br>
    Bee, bee, bee, bee, bee, bee <br>
    Yeah, I'm out the way, yeah, I'm low, okay <br>
    Yeah, the island right here's remote, okay <br>
    I ain't thinkin' about no reaper <br>
    Nigga, I'm reapin' what I sow, okay <br>
    Got a Benjamin and a Jackson all in my house like I'm Joe, okay <br>
    Hellcat, made his homeboys and them type sell they soul, okay <br>
    Everybody wanna be demon 'til they get chipped by your throwaway <br>
    And I might do a show a day, once a lame, always a lame <br>
    Oh, you thought the money, the power or fame would make you go away? <br>
    Have you ever played have-you-ever? Okay, nigga, let's play <br>
    Have you ever walked your enemy down like with a poker face? <br>
    Have you ever paid five hundred thou' like to an open case? <br>
    Well, I have, and I failed at both, but I came out straight <br>
    I hate when a rapper talk about guns, then somebody die <br>
    They turn into nuns, then hop online, like "Pray for my city" <br>
    He fakin' for likes and digital hugs <br>
    His daddy a killer, he wanna be junior, they must've forgot the shit that they done <br>
    Dementia must run in his family, but let it get shaky <br>
    I'll park your son <br>
    The very first time I shot me a Drac', the homie had told me to aim it this way <br>
    I didn't point down enough, today, I'll show you I learned from those mistakes <br>
    Somebody had told me that you got a ring, on God, I'm ready to double the wage <br>
    I'd rather do that than let a Canadian nigga make Pac turn in his grave <br>
    Cutthroat business, you got shit twisted <br>
    What is it? The braids? <br>
    I hurt your feelings? You don't wanna work with me no more? Okay <br>
    It's three G.O.A.T.s left, and I seen two of them kissin' and huggin' on stage <br>
    I love 'em to death, and in eight bars, I'll explain that phrase, huh <br>
    It's nothin' nobody can tell me, huh <br>
    I don't wanna talk on no celly, huh <br>
    You know I got language barriers, huh <br>
    It's no accent you can sell me, huh <br>
    Yeah, Cole and Aubrey know I'm a selfish nigga, the crown is heavy, huh <br>
    I pray they my real friends, if not, I'm YNW Melly <br>
    I don't like you poppin' shit at Pharrell, for him, I inherit the beef <br>
    Yeah, fuck all that pushin' P, let me see you push a T <br>
    You better off spinnin' again on him, you think about pushin' me <br>
    He's Terrence Thornton, I'm Terence Crawford, yeah, I'm whoopin' feet <br>
    We ain't gotta get personal, this a friendly fade, you should keep it that way <br>
    I know some shit about niggas that make Gunna Wunna look like a saint <br>
    This ain't been about critics, not about gimmicks, not about who the greatest <br>
    It's always been about love and hate, now let me say I'm the biggest hater <br>
    I hate the way that you walk, the way that you talk, I hate the way that you dress <br>
    I hate the way that you sneak diss, if I catch flight, it's gon' be direct <br>
    We hate the bitches you fuck, 'cause they confuse themself with real women <br>
    And notice, I said "we, " it's not just me, I'm what the culture feelin' <br>
    How many more fairytale stories 'bout your life 'til we had enough? <br>
    How many more Black features 'til you finally feel that you're Black enough? <br>
    I like Drake with the melodies, I don't like Drake when he act tough <br>
    You gon' make a nigga bring back Puff, let me see if Chubbs really crash somethin' <br>
    Yeah, my first one like my last one, it's a classic, you don't have one <br>
    Let your core audience stomach that, then tell 'em where you get your abs from <br>
    V12, it's a fast one, baow-baow-baow, last one <br>
    Headshot for the year, you better walk around like Daft Punk <br>
    Remember? <br>
    Ayy, Top Dawg, who the fuck they think they playin' with? <br>
    Extortion my middle name as soon as you jump off of that plane, bitch <br>
    I'm allergic to the lame shit, only you like bein' famous <br>
    Yachty can't give you no swag neither, I don't give a fuck 'bout who you hang with <br>
    I hate the way that you walk, the way that you talk, I hate the way that you dress <br>
    Surprised you wanted that feature request <br>
    You know that we got some shit to address <br>
    I even hate when you say the word "nigga, " but that's just me, I guess <br>
    Some shit just cringeworthy, it ain't even gotta be deep, I guess <br>
    Still love when you see success, everything with me is blessed <br>
    Keep makin' me dance, wavin' my hand, and it won't be no threat <br>
    I'm knowin' they call you The Boy, but where is a man? 'Cause I ain't seen him yet <br>
    Matter fact, I ain't even bleed him yet, can I bleed him? Bet <br>
    When I see you stand by Sexyy Red, I believe you see two bad bitches <br>
    I believe you don't like women, it's real competition, you might pop ass with 'em <br>
    Let's speak on percentage, show me your splits, I'll make sure I double back with you <br>
    You were signed to a nigga that's signed to a nigga that said he was signed to that nigga <br>
    Try cease and desist on the "Like That" record? <br>
    Hoe, what? You ain't like that record? <br>
    "Back To Back, " I like that record <br>
    I'ma get back to that, for the record <br>
    Why would I call around tryna get dirt on niggas? Y'all think all my life is rap? <br>
    That's hoe shit, I got a son to raise, but I can see you don't know nothin' 'bout that <br>
    Wakin' him up, know nothin' 'bout that <br>
    And tell him to pray, know nothin' 'bout that <br>
    And givin' him tools to walk through life like day-by-day, know nothin' 'bout that <br>
    Teachin' him morals, integrity, discipline, listen, man, you don't know nothin' 'bout that <br>
    Speakin' the truth and consider what God's considerin', you don't know nothin' 'bout that <br>
    Ain't 20-v-1, it's 1-v-20 if I gotta smack niggas that write with you <br>
    Yeah, bring 'em out too, I'll clean 'em out too <br>
    Tell BEAM that he better stay right with you <br>
    Am I battlin' ghost or AI? Nigga feelin' like Joel Hale Osteen <br>
    Funny, he was in a film called "AI" <br>
    And my sixth sense tellin' me to off him <br>
    I'ma blick niggas all in they coffin <br>
    Yeah, OV-hoe niggas is dick riders <br>
    Tell 'em run to America, they imitate heritage, they can't imitate this violence <br>
    What I learned is niggas don't like the West Coast <br>
    And I'm fine with it, I'll push the line with it <br>
    Pick a nigga off one at a time with it <br>
    We can be on a three-hour time difference <br>
    Don't speak on the family, crodie <br>
    It can get deep in the family, crodie <br>
    Talk about me and my family, crodie? <br>
    Someone gon' bleed in your family, crodie <br>
    I be at New Ho King eatin' fried rice with a dip sauce and blammy, crodie <br>
    Tell me you're cheesin', fam <br>
    We can do this right now on the camera, crodie <br>
    Ayy, fuck y'all niggas, I don't trust y'all niggas <br>
    I wave one finger and thump y'all niggas like mmm <br>
    Field goal, punt y'all niggas, they punk y'all niggas, nobody never took my food <br>
    Whoever that's fuckin' with him, fuck you niggas, and fuck the industry too <br>
    If you take it there, I'm takin' it further <br>
    Psst, that's somethin' you don't wanna do <br>
    Ooh <br>
    We don't wanna hear you say "nigga" no more <br>
